## Description
`The Search-Bar` component is a web application feature designed to help users search for and access information efficiently. It allows users to type keywords and get instant suggestions based on the input, such as artist names, album titles, or venues. This component is optimized for real-time search and user interactivity, enhancing the user experience within applications that manage and display large collections of data, like music or artist information.

### Features

1. **Autocomplete Suggestions:** Provides users with autocomplete suggestions as they type, displaying relevant results that match the input.
2. **Real-Time Search:** Allows users to search instantly without reloading the page, providing a seamless experience for finding artists, albums, and tour dates.
3. **Responsive Design:** The search bar is fully responsive, offering an optimized experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **Navigation:** Users can click on any search result to navigate directly to the corresponding section, such as an artist profile, album details, or tour information.

### Instalation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```go
    git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/ebarsula/groupie-tracker-search-bar
    cd groupie-tracker-searh-bar
    ```
2. Install Go and set up your Go environment if you haven't already. You can download and install Go from the official Go website.

3. Run the application:

    ```go
    go run main.go
    ```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.


## Usage

- **Start Typing:** Begin typing in the search bar, and autocomplete suggestions will appear based on the input.
- **Click Suggestions:** Click on a suggestion to be taken to the relevant page or section.
- **Filter by Category:** Filter results by artists, albums, or venues for more accurate search results (if available).

## Implementation

`The Search-Bar` component is implemented using Go for the backend, JavaScript for real-time interactions, and HTML/CSS for the layout and design.
1. **Search Algorithm:** The backend uses a simple search algorithm to filter through artist and album names based on the userâ€™s input. The search results are matched with keywords and ranked for relevance.
2. **JavaScript for Interactivity:** JavaScript is used to handle input events and display suggestions as the user types. It listens for each keystroke, sends requests to the backend for matching data, and renders the results dynamically.
3. **Backend Handlers:** The backend is responsible for handling search requests, retrieving data, and formatting results to be sent to the frontend for display.
4. **HTML and CSS for Design:** The frontend design provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to interact with. The search bar component is styled to fit within the broader application layout.
